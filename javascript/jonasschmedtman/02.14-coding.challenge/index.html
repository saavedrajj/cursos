	<h1>Coding Challenge 1</h1>

	<p>John and a friend invented a simple game where the player with the highest value of height (in centimeters) plus five time his age wins (what a silly gamge :)</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Create variables for the heights and ages of two friends and assign them some values.</li>
		<li>Calculate their scores.</li>
		<li>Decide who wins and print the winner to the console. Include the score in the string that you output to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw (both players with the same score).</li>
		<li>4. EXTRA: Add a third player and now decide who wins. Hint: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can's solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem</li>
	</ol>
