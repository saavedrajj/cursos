	<h1>Coding Challenge 2</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>Create an array with some years where persons were born</li>
		<li>Create an empty array (just[])</li>
		<li>Use a loop to fill the array with the ages of the persons</li>
		<li>Use another loop to log into the console whether each person is of full age (18 or older), as well as their age</li>
		<li>Finally, create a function called printFullAge which receives the vector of years as an argument, executes the steps 2., 3. and 4. and returns a vector of true/false boolean values: true if the person is of full age (>= 18 years) and false if not (< 18 years)</li>
		<li>Call the function with two different vectors and store the results in two variables: full_1 and full_2</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Example input: [1965, 2008, 1992]</p>
	<p>Example output: [true, false, true]</p>
	<p>Hint: you can use a loop not only to read from an array, like y[i], but also to set values in an array, like y[i] = ... You can also use the specific array methods.</p>
